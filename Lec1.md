# Why Machine Learning with Graphs is Needed?
## Problem
Many types of data are represented as a graph. But, modern deep learning algorithms are designed for simple sequences & grids

## Solution
We use representation learing which automatically learn the feature. Then, map nodes to d-dimensional vectors such that similar nodes in the graph are embedded close together.
